## REVERSE MONEY CRYPTO CURRENCY
#### <b> an advanced economic system where you get paid to spend money. this is just a joke but i was fired up one day and wrote the smart contract + this screed.  </b>
<p> <i>Satashi Nakomoto’s invention of Bitcoin showed that through the distributed consensus of a blockchain, a digital asset can exist with no institutional backing or intrinsic value. This has enabled developers to create their own virtual currencies that simulate alternative economic systems. Reverse Money aims to showcase a system in which one’s balance is never decreased after making a transaction, instead, more coins are minted to fill the void. This incentivizes constant spending between users, resulting in a currency that is rapidly inflating and unstable.  We aim to create an environment where these coins can be exchanged and used to purchase digital assets. By limiting the frequency of trades one can make with a specific user, participants are encouraged to recruit others to join the network. This creates a fast growing and chaotic market that is addicting to participate in, an experiment that illuminates the fickleness of speculative currency itself.</i></p>
